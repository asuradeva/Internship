#### The pipeline should have 5 jobs (Job A to Job E)

- Job A - takes in two numbers, lets say a and b and in the job these number get added and the result is printed out.
- Job B - takes in the result from Job A and checks if that number is an odd or even number and prints the result, if the number is even - go to Job C else go to Job D.
- Job C - divide the result of Job B by 2 and print the result
- Job D - multiply the result of Job B by 2 and print the result
- Job E - multiply the result of either Job C or Job D(whichever ran) by itself and check if that is an even number or not and print that result
