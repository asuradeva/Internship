>Phase 1
    * A proposer asks all the working acceptors whether anyone already received a proposal. If the answer is no, propose a value.

>Phase 2
    * If a majority of acceptors agree to this value then that is our consensus.

When a proposer receives a client request to reach consensus on a value, the proposer must create a proposal number. This number must have two properties:
1. It must be unique. No two proposers can come up with the same number. An easy way of doing this is to use a global process identifier for the least significant bits of the number. For example, instead of an ID=12, node 3 will generate ID=12.3 and node 2 will generate 12.2.
2. It must be bigger than any previously used identifier used in the cluster. A proposer may use an incrementing counter to achieve this. If the number is not bigger than one previously used, the proposer will find out by having its proposal rejected and will have to try again.

##Phase 1
* A proposer receives a consensus request for a VALUE from a client. It creates a unique proposal number, ID, and sends a PREPARE(ID) message to at least a majority of acceptors.

* Each acceptor that receives the PREPARE message looks at the ID in the message and decides:
    ```
    Is this ID bigger than any round I have previously received?
    If yes
        store the ID number, max_id = ID
        respond with a PROMISE message
    If no
        do not respond (or respond with a "fail" message)
    ```
* If the proposer receives a PROMISE response from a majority of acceptors, it now knows that a majority of them are willing to participate in this proposal. The proposer can now proceed with getting consensus. Each of these acceptors made a promise that no other proposal with a smaller number can make it to consensus.

##Phase 2
* If a proposer received a PROMISE message from the majority of acceptors, it now has to tell the acceptors to accept that proposal. If not, it has to start over with another round of Paxos.

* In this phase of the protocol, the proposer tells all the acceptors (that are live) what value to accept. It sends: `PROPOSE(ID, VALUE)` to a majority or all of the acceptors. Each acceptor now decides whether to accept the proposal. It accepts the proposal if the ID number of the proposal is still the largest one that it has seen. Recall that an acceptor promised not to accept proposals from PREPARE messages with smaller numbers but can and will accept proposals with higher numbers. The logic the acceptor uses is:
    ```
    is the ID the largest I have seen so far, max_id == N?
    if yes
        reply with an ACCEPTED message & send ACCEPTED(ID, VALUE) to all learners
    if no
        do not respond (or respond with a "fail" message)
    ```

* The ACCEPTED message can be sent back to the proposer as well as to the learners so they can propagate the value to wherever its action is needed (e.g., append to a log, modify a replicated database, â€¦). When the proposer or learner receives a majority of accept messages then it knows that consensus has been reached on the value.

To summarize, in the first phase, the proposer finds out that no promises have been made to higher numbered proposals. In the second phase, the proposer asks the acceptors to accept the proposal with a specific value. As long as no higher numbered proposals have arrived during this time, the acceptor responds back that the proposal has been accepted.
